          <strong>Biological and Machine Intelligence (BAMI)</strong> is a
          living book authored by Numenta researchers and engineers. Its purpose
          is to document Hierarchical Temporal Memory, a theoretical framework
          for both biological and machine intelligence. While there’s a lot more
          work to be done on HTM theory, we have made good progress on several
          components of a comprehensive theory of the neocortex and how to apply
          that knowledge to practical applications.  We would like to share our
          work as we go.  We hope this book will become the standard reference
          for people who want to learn about HTM cortical theory and its
          applications for machine intelligence. Going forward we anticipate
          using two main forms of documentation of our research, one is
          published research papers and the other is additions to this book,
          Biological and Machine Intelligence.

          Just as we make all of our research and technology available in open
          source, we want to be transparent with this manuscript as well, even
          well-ahead of its completion. When it is finished, this book will
          cover all the fundamental concepts of HTM theory. For now, we are
          sharing the chapters that have been completed, each of which contains
          a revision history, so you can see what has changed in each chapter.
          Over time, we will add chapters to BAMI.

          The “Content to be Incorporated” section has place holders for new
          chapters. Importantly, it contains links to updated psuedocode for the
          current Spatial Pooler and Temporal Memory algorithms. It also has
          links to scientific papers and other material that cover topics we
          intend to make into chapters.

          We will make revisions available on an occasional basis. If you want
