        <h3>Time-based Pattern Detection</h3>
        <p>
          Automatically analyzes time-based patterns on a company by company
          basis to identify anomalies. The HTM algorithm ensures that reported
          anomalies are rare (avoiding false positives), and that real anomalies
          can be detected, even if humans canâ€™t see them (avoiding false
          negatives).
        </p>

        <h3>Most Anomalous Companies Highlighted</h3>
        <p>
          Companies are listed in order of most anomalous in the past 24
          hours so everything the user wants to see is usually visible on
          one page.

        <h3>Root-cause analysis</h3>
        <p>
          Displays tweets around the same time as anomalies so you can
          easily see what people are saying and why something unusual is
          happening.
