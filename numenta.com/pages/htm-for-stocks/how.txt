        <h3>Ingests real-time stock and Twitter data</h3>
        <p>
          For each monitored company, data is collected every five minutes for
          stock price, stock volume and Twitter volume.  Actual data charts can
          be viewed in the application.
        </p>

        <h3>Models build automatically</h3>
        <p>
          Models are automatically built and refined for each data stream.
          No data scientists are required!

        <h3>Anomalies are based on deviation from recent performance</h3>
        <p>
          Each company is different. HTM models report anomalies when current
          behavior deviates from recent behavior.
