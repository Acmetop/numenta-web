        <Paragraph>
          Automatically analyzes time-based patterns on a company by company
          basis to identify anomalies. The HTM algorithm ensures that reported
          anomalies are rare (avoiding false positives), and that real anomalies
          can be detected, even if humans canâ€™t see them (avoiding false
          negatives).
