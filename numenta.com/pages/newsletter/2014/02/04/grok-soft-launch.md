title: Announcing Grok 1.0 Soft Launch
---

**NOTE:** Numenta has [announced a strategic partnership with Avik Partners](/press/numenta-announces-licensing-of-grok-for-it-to-avik-partners.html),
please read more about the future of
[Grok for IT Analytics](http://grokstream.com).

I am pleased to share with our newsletter subscribers the availability of Grok
1.0 in "soft launch" on the
<a href="/grok/#get">Amazon Web Services (AWS) Marketplace</a>.
Grok monitors complex networks running on AWS and is the first commercial
application of our groundbreaking Cortical Learning Algorithm (CLA).
Grok enables IT professionals to easily spot unusual activity, thus staying
ahead of problems and preventing downtime. Grok includes the following features:

* Very easy configuration and set-up
* Using the CLA, automatically models each metric to determine normal patterns
* Automatically identifies and ranks unusual patterns
* Continuously learns new patterns as environments evolve
* Does not require any manual threshold setting
* Notifies the user when something curious is happening
* Displays output graphically on a mobile Android device

Using Grok will enable IT professionals to get insights to their system
performance by providing an early warning that something has changed.
Since everything happens automatically, using Grok can reduce costs of system
monitoring by requiring less work from engineers. And, given the mobile
interface, IT professionals can get this information anytime, anywhere.

Grok 1.0 is available in two editions:

* <a href="https://aws.amazon.com/marketplace/pp/B00I18SNQ6/ref=srh_res_product_title?ie=UTF8&sr=0-3&qid=1391115095261">Grok Free Edition</a>; supports up to 10 AWS instances or custom metrics
* <a href="https://aws.amazon.com/marketplace/pp/B00HJAA5MM/ref=srh_res_product_title?ie=UTF8&sr=0-2&qid=1391115112131">Grok Standard Edition</a>; supports up to 200 AWS instances or custom metrics (fee based)

We plan to formally announce and exhibit at the AWS Summit on March 25-26 at the
Moscone Center in San Francisco; please stop by and say hello. And be sure
to check out our updated website.

I'm also happy to tell you that in addition to working on the Grok product
release, we continue to push our biologically-inspired algorithms forward.
We've made some important progress recently and look forward to sharing it
with you over the coming year. Our open source community,
<a href="http://numenta.org/">NuPIC</a>, is growing and actively contributing to
the advancement of the science.

Thank you for your support and your interest. We hope you'll try
Grok and give us your feedback.
