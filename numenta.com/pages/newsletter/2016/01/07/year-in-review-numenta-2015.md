### Numenta Newsletter &mdash; January 07, 2016

As we look forward to a bright 2016 here at Numenta, I thought I’d pause and
review the highlights of 2015.  From advancing our research to expanding our
community, we had many accomplishments that laid the groundwork for significant
progress going forward. I’d like to share four highlights.

1. In 2015, we signed up two key strategic partners:
  [Cortical.io](http://www.cortical.io/) and
  [Avik Partners](http://www.grokstream.com/#home).  In May, we
  [announced our Cortical.io partnership](http://numenta.com/press/numenta-and-cortical-io-form-strategic-partnership.html),
  which focuses on advancing natural language processing (NLP).  We believe that
  the combination of our HTM technology and Cortical’s Semantic Folding
  technology provides new possibilities to understanding text.  Co-founder
  Francisco Webber has been a long-time supporter of Numenta. We look forward to
  continued collaboration with him and his team.

  In August, we
  [announced our partnership with Avik Partners](http://numenta.com/press/numenta-announces-licensing-of-grok-for-it-to-avik-partners.html),
  an IT services and advanced analytics startup to whom we transferred our Grok
  application.  In a short time, Avik CEO Casey Kindiger launched a
  [commercial application](http://www.grokstream.com/#home) to use Grok to
  monitor IT infrastructure. This partnership is a great example of our
  “technology transfer” business model where other companies complete and
  commercialize our example applications.

  We can’t wait to see exciting results from Cortical.io and Avik Partners, and
  I hope to share news of additional partnerships with you in the coming year.

2. We also released the
  [Numenta Anomaly Benchmark (NAB)](http://numenta.com/numenta-anomaly-benchmark/),
  which was two years in the making.  We believe NAB offers the definitive way
  to assess the performance of algorithms for detecting anomalies in streaming
  data.  We presented NAB v1.0 at two conferences and continue to get positive
  feedback supporting the need for this benchmark. The launch was just the
  beginning for NAB. We are actively working to collect additional data sources
  and publish additional algorithm results to incorporate in the next version.
  Stay tuned for details on a NAB competition we are running this year in
  conjunction with the
  [IEEE World Congress on Computational Intelligence](http://www.wcci2016.org/programs.php?id=home).

3. This year also was a great year for our growing [NuPIC](http://numenta.org/)
  community, which received a Top 3 ranking in a KDNuggets report on the
  [Top 20 Python Machine Learning Open Source Projects](http://www.kdnuggets.com/2015/06/top-20-python-machine-learning-open-source-projects.html).
  We increased the number of NuPIC followers by 750, put more of our technology
  into open source, and had two hackathons that demonstrated the
  [broad applicability of HTM applications](http://numenta.com/blog/htm-challenge-2015-results.html).
  I encourage you to
  [view the videos](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PL3yXMgtrZmDqZc2m7qI3Kkbmxechp2-Zs)
  from our most recent hackathon.  

4. Perhaps one of the most exciting achievements of 2015 was the progress toward
  a goal that we set at the beginning of the year: to [publish major papers](/papers/) about our work.
  We have several papers undergoing peer review, which we’ve  made available
  pre-publication on arxiv, an academic archive. I hope to be  sharing news of
  publication over the coming months, but in the meantime, you  can find all our
  papers on arxiv, here:   

  * [Why Neurons Have Thousands of Synapses, A Theory of Sequence Memory in Neocortex](http://arxiv.org/abs/1511.00083)
    (Preprint of journal submission) – Foundational paper describing core HTM
    theory for sequence memory and its relationship to the neocortex. Written
    with a neuroscience perspective, the paper explains why neurons need so many
    synapses and how networks of neurons can form a powerful sequence learning
    mechanism.

  * [Continuous online sequence learning with an unsupervised neural network model](http://arxiv.org/abs/1512.05463)
    (Preprint of journal submission) – Analysis of HTM sequence memory applied
    to various sequence learning and prediction problems. Written with a machine
    learning perspective, the paper contains some comparisons to statistical and
    Deep Learning techniques.

  * [Evaluating Real-time Anomaly Detection Algorithms](http://arxiv.org/abs/1510.03336) -
    the Numenta Anomaly Benchmark  (Published conference paper) – This paper
    discusses how we should think about anomaly detection for streaming
    applications. It introduces a new open-source benchmark for detecting
    anomalies in real-time, time-series data.

  * [How do neurons operate on sparse distributed representations? A mathematical theory of sparsity, neurons and active dendrites](http://arxiv.org/abs/1601.00720)
    (Preprint of journal submission) – This paper describes a mathematical model
    for quantifying the benefits and limitations of sparse representations in
    neurons and cortical networks.

  * [Properties of Sparse Distributed Representations and their Application to Hierarchical Temporal Memory](http://arxiv.org/abs/1503.07469) –
    An earlier version of the above submission, this paper applies our
    mathematical model of sparse representations to practical HTM systems.

  * [Porting HTM Models to the Heidelberg Neuromorphic Computing Platform](http://arxiv.org/abs/1505.02142) –
    Recently there has been much interest in building custom hardware
    implementations of HTM systems. This paper discusses one such scenario, and
    shows how to port HTM algorithms to analog hardware platforms such as the
    one developed by the Human Brain Project.

As we kick off 2016, I am excited for what’s in store.  We are working to make
Numenta technology even more accessible. We have several events and publications
planned. And we will remain dedicated to driving the creation of machine
intelligence through neocortical principles.  

Best wishes for a Happy New Year.
