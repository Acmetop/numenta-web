          Because we want our technology to be broadly adopted, we make it
          broadly accessible as well. We are committed to transparency of
          our ideas, technology and research.  We have developed an open
          source project called NuPIC (Numenta Platform for Intelligent
          Computing), where youâ€™ll find all of our algorithms and daily
          research code documented. NuPIC comprises a community of
          researchers, data scientists and developers working on our
          Hierarchical Temporal Memory technology.
        </Paragraph>
        <Paragraph>
          NuPIC includes a discussion forum covering a variety of topics,
          including HTM theory, research on extending HTM, and source code
          for complete applications based on HTM. If you are interested in
          seeing, developing or working with our technology, we invite you
          to participate at {' '}
