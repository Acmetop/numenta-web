**NOTE:** Numenta has [announced a strategic partnership with Avik Partners](/press/numenta-announces-licensing-of-grok-for-it-to-avik-partners.html),
please read more about the future of
[Grok for IT Analytics](http://grokstream.com).

Numenta, Inc. today announced the commercial
availability of Grok for IT Analytics on Amazon Web Services (AWS) in the
[AWS Marketplace](/grok/#get). [Grok](/grok/) anomaly detection
leverages sophisticated machine intelligence algorithms to enable new insights
into critical IT systems. Grok automatically learns complex patterns and then
highlights unusual behavior.  As software topologies and usage patterns change,
Grok continuously learns and adapts, eliminating the need for frequent resetting
of thresholds. Visualization of Grok output is displayed on a constantly updated
mobile device, enabling IT professionals to assess the health of their systems
anytime, anywhere.  Using Grok, IT operators can better prevent business
downtime while reducing false positives.

Grok is the first commercial application of Numenta’s groundbreaking Cortical Learning Algorithm
(CLA), biologically inspired algorithms for machine intelligence. The core
CLA technology is ideal for large-scale analysis of continuously streaming
datasets and excels at modeling and predicting patterns in data.

“Grok provides an early warning system to IT professionals to give them real-
time insights into their system performance,” said Numenta CEO Donna Dubinsky.
“Grok anticipates problems before they happen, reduces false positives, and
lowers engineering costs through automated modeling and continuous learning.”

Grok features include:

* Monitoring of performance and health of AWS environments or other systems
* Automatic modeling to determine normal patterns
* Automatic identification and ranking of unusual patterns
* Continuous learning of new patterns as environments evolve – no need for
manual threshold setting
* Notification to user when an anomaly occurs
* Output displayed graphically on an Android mobile device
* Simple setup via a web-based or command-line interface
* Support for AWS auto-scaling groups and logical clusters

Grok is available now:

* [Grok Free Edition](https://aws.amazon.com/marketplace/pp/B00I18SNQ6/ref=srh_res_product_title?ie=UTF8&sr=0-3&qid=1391115095261); supports up to 10 AWS instances or custom metrics

Grok will be demonstrated in Booth 100 at the
[AWS Summit](https://aws.amazon.com/aws-summit-2014/) on March 26 at the
Moscone Center in San Francisco.

In addition to working on the Grok product release, Numenta continues to push
its biologically-inspired algorithms forward.  “We’ve made some important
progress recently and look forward to sharing it with our community over the
coming year,” said Jeff Hawkins, Numenta co-founder. “Our open source community,
[NuPIC](http://numenta.org), is also growing and actively
contributing to the advancement of the science.”


#### About Numenta Inc.

Numenta, Inc., was founded in 2005 to be a catalyst in the emerging field of
machine intelligence. Numenta builds solutions that help companies automatically
and intelligently act on machine generated data.  Its biologically inspired
machine learning technology is based on a theory of the neocortex first
described in co-founder Jeff Hawkins’ book, **On Intelligence**. Its first
commercial product, called Grok, offers a breakthrough solution for anomaly
detection for IT Operations. In addition, Numenta has created NuPIC (Numenta
Platform for Intelligent Computing) as an open source project.

Numenta is based in Redwood City, California. It is privately funded.
