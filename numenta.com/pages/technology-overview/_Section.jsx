        Based on a wealth of neuroscience evidence we have created a
        technology called HTM (Hierarchical Temporal Memory) that models key
        aspects of neocortical learning. HTM is well suited for prediction,
        anomaly detection, classification and ultimately sensori-motor
        applications.

      <Paragraph>
        At the core of HTM are time-based learning algorithms that can
        store, learn, infer and recall high-order sequences. Unlike most
        other machine learning methods, HTM learns time-based patterns in
        data on a continuous basis. HTM is extremely high capacity, meaning
        that it can learn multiple patterns simultaneously.  It is also
        robust to noise and can learn continuously from unlabeled data.
      </Paragraph>
      <Paragraph>
        HTM works best with data that meets the following characteristics:

          Underlying patterns in the data that change over time

          Many individual data sources where hand crafting separate models

          Data with time-based patterns

          Data for which simple techniques such as thresholds yield

        Our technology has been tested and implemented in software, all of
        which is developed with best practices and suitable for deploying in
        commercial applications.
