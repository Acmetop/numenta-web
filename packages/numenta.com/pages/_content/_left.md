Numenta is tackling one of the most important scientific challenges of all
time: reverse engineering the neocortex. Studying how the brain works helps us
understand the principles of intelligence and build machines that work on the
same principles. We believe that understanding how the neocortex works is the
fastest path to machine intelligence, and creating intelligent machines is
important for the continued success of humankind.

**A New Theory for Intelligence and Cortical Function**
In October 2018 we released a major new theory for intelligence and cortical
computation. We have several resources available for you to learn more.
