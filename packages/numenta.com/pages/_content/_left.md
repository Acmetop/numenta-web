Numenta is tackling one of the most important scientific challenges of all
time: reverse engineering the neocortex. Studying how the brain works helps us
understand the principles of intelligence and build machines that work on the
same principles. We believe that understanding how the neocortex works is the
fastest path to machine intelligence, and creating intelligent machines is
important for the continued success of humankind.

We are at the beginning of a thrilling new era of computing that will unfold
over the coming decades, and we invite you to learn about how our approach is
helping to advance the state of brain theory and machine intelligence.

In October 2018 we released a major new paper that describes a framework for
how the cortical column works.
