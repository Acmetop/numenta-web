title: Anomaly Detection Benchmark | Numenta
description: The Numenta Anomaly Benchmark (NAB) is an anomaly detection benchmark that measures results from algorithms designed to find anomalies in streaming data. NAB is an open source framework with a real-world, labeled dataset, and a scoring mechanism that rewards early detection and on-line learning.

The need for anomaly detection has grown, as the Internet of Things
has produced a world thatâ€™s overflowing with streaming data. As
these data sources continue to grow, so does the need for anomaly
detection. Uncovering anomalies allows you to:

* Detect potential machine failures
* Recognize changes in Twitter activity
* Identify unexpected traffic patterns

We created the **Numenta Anomaly Benchmark (NAB)** in order to be able to
measure and compare results from algorithms designed to find anomalies in
streaming data. NAB is an open source framework consisting of:

* A dataset with real-world, labeled data files
* A scoring mechanism that rewards early detection and on-line learning
