### In Honor of HTM School’s First Anniversary: HTM School Podcast

HTM School turned one this month, and it has accomplished a lot in its first
year. With 35,000 views and counting, the series has gained a loyal following of
eager students soaking up the relevant components of brain theory.

As an HTM School student myself, one of the things that has intrigued me most
has been the production and evolution of the series. From concept to creation,
the entire process is handled by [one person](https://discourse.numenta.org/u/rhyolight/summary),
in a garage far, far away – or at least a 3.5 hour drive.

I asked Matt to take me behind the scenes and talk about how each episode gets
made. In this podcast, we talk about how he comes up with the concepts and
visualizations, what a day of filming looks like, and the finer points of Final Cut Pro.

Take a listen and share the podcast with others who can benefit from HTM
Education. Questions about the series of specific episodes? Post them in the
[HTM Forum](https://discourse.numenta.org/c/other-topics/youtube).

*Pre-production planning: Green screen, camera, scripts, visuals, tripods, lighting*

![Garage](../images/garage.jpg)

*On non-production days, the film studio goes back to being a home office / garage*

*Green Screen and proper lighting are key to all of Matt’s visualizations*

*From green screen to computer screen – the final product is full of interesting visuals.*
