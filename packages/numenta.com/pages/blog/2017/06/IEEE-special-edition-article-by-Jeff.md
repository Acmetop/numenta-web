IEEE Spectrum, the flagship magazine and website of the Institute of Electrical and Electronics
 Engineers, recently published [a special report devoted to brains](http://spectrum.ieee.org/static/special-report-can-we-copy-the-brain).
 Specifically, the issue looks at efforts to recreate human cognition and how understanding brains
 will enable the next generation of computing and transform our lives.  Our co-founder, Jeff
 Hawkins, was invited to write an article for this edition. His piece, “What Intelligent Machines
 Need To Learn From The Neocortex,” makes the case for why we need to know how the brain works in
 order to build intelligent machines and which essential attributes of intelligence we cannot
 overlook.

Tune in to my interview with Jeff, in which he discusses the article.  I asked him to walk through
each feature of intelligence he identified in the piece, one of which involves a key discovery in
Numenta’s brain theory and sensorimotor integration research.  

The full article is available in print for IEEE Spectrum subscribers or online at xxx. Share your
