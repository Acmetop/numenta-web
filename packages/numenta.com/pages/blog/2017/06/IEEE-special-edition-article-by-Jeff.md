IEEE Spectrum, the flagship magazine and website of the Institute of Electrical and Electronics
 Engineers, recently published [a special report devoted to brains](http://spectrum.ieee.org/static/special-report-can-we-copy-the-brain).
 Specifically, the issue looks at efforts to recreate human cognition and how understanding brains
 will enable the next generation of computing and transform our lives.  Our co-founder, Jeff
 Hawkins, was invited to write an article for this edition. In his piece, “What Intelligent
 Machines Need To Learn From The Neocortex,” Jeff argues that machines won’t become intelligent
 unless they incorporate certain features of the human brain, and he highlights three of them.
 This article is particularly exciting for Numenta because it’s the first one that includes our
 latest discovery in sensorimotor integration.  

I sat down with Jeff to talk with him about the article. Click on the image above to hear our
conversation, in which I asked him to discuss the importance of building biologically based
intelligent machines, the features of intelligence we can’t ignore and the far reaching
implications of machine intelligence.    

The full article is available in print for IEEE Spectrum subscribers or [online at this link](http://spectrum.ieee.org/computing/software/what-intelligent-machines-need-to-learn-from-the-neocortex). We'd love to know what you think. Share your
thoughts about the article in the comments or continue the discussion on the [HTM Forum](https://discourse.numenta.org/).
