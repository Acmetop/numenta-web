The ***Brain Science Podcast***, hosted by [Dr. Ginger Campbell](http://gingercampbell.com/), features recent discoveries about neuroscience and interviews with scientists around the world.  “Dr. Campbell believes that understanding how the brain works gives us insight into what makes us human. She is also committed to showing how the scientific method has unraveled many long-standing mysteries.”

As Dr. Campbell explains, The ***Brain Science Podcast*** was partially inspired by Jeff and his book [On Intelligence](https://numenta.com/papers-videos-and-more/resources/on-intelligence/), and Jeff was one of the show's first guests in 2006.  Now, more than a decade later, Dr. Campbell invited Jeff back to interview him about our latest work.  

In a [new episode](http://brainsciencepodcast.com/bsp/2017/139-hawkins), Jeff discusses two key peer-reviewed papers that Numenta has published over the last two years:

 - [Why Neurons Have Thousands of Synapses, A Theory of Sequence Memory in the Neocortex](https://numenta.com/papers/why-neurons-have-thousands-of-synapses-theory-of-sequence-memory-in-neocortex/) (2016) 
 - [A Theory of How Columns in the Neocortex Enable Learning the Structure of the World](https://numenta.com/papers/a-theory-of-how-columns-in-the-neocortex-enable-learning-the-structure-of-the-world/) (2017)

Jeff explains how our latest research uncovers a key feature of cortical function that has been completely missed: a *location signal*.  

> "As soon as you add this location signal, then all kinds of things
> make sense, and all kinds of mysteries get resolved, and all of a
> sudden we can understand what all these layers are doing, and it tells
> us that the cortex, even a single column of the cortex, is much more
> powerful than people thought.  It allows even a small section of the
> cortex to model complete objects and know the entire structure of
> objects."
