There are some pretty interesting conversations that take place within the walls of Numenta on a regular basis - from visiting neuroscientists exploring connections between their work and our theories to Numenta employees drawing up examples of a recent discovery in action. These conversations are an important part of our research process.

And now we want to bring these conversations to you. That’s why we’re launching a new podcast series called *[Numenta On Intelligence](https://www.buzzsprout.com/188368)* that I’m co-hosting with our Open Source Community Manager, Matt Taylor.

Just like it sounds, *Numenta On Intelligence* is a podcast about intelligence - specifically, how it works in the brain and how understanding the biological principles may be the most efficient path to machine intelligence.  

Every month we’ll bring you a new episode that features a conversation about brain-related topics.  Some will dive into neuroscience, like our upcoming two-part premiere episode with Matt interviewing Numenta Co-founder Jeff Hawkins about a couple of our more recent research concepts.  Others will be appropriate for non-scientific listeners who are simply curious about how the brain works and why that’s such an important problem to solve.

*Numenta On Intelligence* is available now on [iTunes](https://itunes.apple.com/us/podcast/numenta-on-intelligence/id1406940219), [Stitcher](https://www.stitcher.com/podcast/numenta-on-intelligence), [Google Play](https://play.google.com/music/listen?u=1#/ps/Iso5mnblc5aksx4k6etlz5243se), and many other podcast providers.
