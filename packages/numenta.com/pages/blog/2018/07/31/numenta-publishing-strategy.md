*Lately we have received questions about our publishing strategy and why we share articles that have not yet been published in a scientific journal.  Our co-founder, Jeff Hawkins responded to a [recent thread on this topic on our HTM Forum](https://discourse.numenta.org/t/why-are-only-a-few-numenta-papers-published-in-scientific-journals/4217). For those of you who are not active there, you can read a slightly modified version of his post below.*

Peer reviewed papers have been the standard and preferred form of publication for many years. They are essential for career advancement in academia, so as other people on our forum pointed out, academic scientists are often under pressure to publish many papers. Sometimes this leads to papers that are of questionable value in terms of scientific advancement. But overall the system works ok.

Industrial research labs have less of this pressure and it is common for them to publish non-peer reviewed research notes and post them on their websites. Many people appreciate being able to access these even though they are not peer-reviewed. Major advances from industrial labs will typically be published in journals, but not always. Sometimes they are considered trade secrets and the scientists get upset if they cannot publish their results.

It is a lot of work and takes a long time to get a peer-reviewed paper published. After submission, it may take a few months to a year. This is such a long time that scientists have started posting their manuscripts to preprint servers. This began in physics but has now spread to other fields. The big one for neuroscience is “bioRxiv”. Most journals permit this, but not all. The final paper, when approved, will be similar to what is on the preprint server. Often a lab or university will put out a press release when the preprint version is available and not when the final paper is accepted. It is generally considered ok to cite preprint articles as long as you change your citation when and if the final paper is accepted. There is a movement underway to make preprint servers the final publishing forum and opening them peer-review in a wiki-like fashion.

There are two types of journals. Open access and closed access. This is a huge topic (easy to find articles about it). To many people (me included) the old model of closed access is broken as it can be prohibitively expensive to read articles on closed journals. Unfortunately, some of the most “prestigious” journals are closed access. This is changing as more and more scientists refuse to publish in closed journals.

Ok, what about Numenta? It takes many months to write a paper and many more to get it published, so in the past we chose to work more on the science and delay publication. Our first peer-reviewed paper, “[Why Neurons Have Thousands of Synapses, A Theory of Sequence Memory in Neocortex](/neuroscience-research/research-publications/papers/why-neurons-have-thousands-of-synapses-theory-of-sequence-memory-in-neocortex/)” was published two and a half years ago. We now have five total and three more being written. This is a pretty good rate given the size of our team. (Some scientists may work on one paper for several years.) Most journals keep track of statistics such as how many times a paper has been downloaded and how many times it has been cited. If you are interested you can track the statistics for our papers.

Peer-reviewed papers are not the only means we use to publish. We also present posters at conferences. These can be very competitive and undergo peer-review to get accepted. We post all our [conference posters](/neuroscience-research/research-publications/posters/) on our website. We also give invited talks and, when we can, we post [links to the talks](/resources/videos/). Finally, we also post smaller papers and research notes on our website. Usually we do this because the topic has a limited audience or represents a sub-topic of something we published elsewhere.

Our goal is to make all of our research accessible. We hope to have our major discoveries published in open access peer-reviewed journals, while other work will be shared on our website. Ultimately the impact of our work will not be determined by the number of papers we publish but by whether the ideas we are bringing to the table are significant and correct. I am confident they are, but time will tell.
