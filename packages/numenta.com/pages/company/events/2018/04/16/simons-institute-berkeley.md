## About:

Jeff Hawkins has been invited to speak at the Computational Theories of the Brain Workshop at the Simons Institute at UC Berkeley. This workshop​ ​is about general computational principles ​for ​networks of neurons that help us understand experimental data, about principles that enable us to reproduce aspects of the brain's astounding computational capability in models and neuromorphic hardware, and about the connections between computational neuroscience and machine learning.
