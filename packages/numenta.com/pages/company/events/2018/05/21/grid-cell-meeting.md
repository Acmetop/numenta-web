## About:

Entorhinal grid cells express spatially regular firing patterns, thought to support self-localisation and navigation. Recent advances suggest grid representations may generalise to non-spatial domains; providing a mechanism for organising conceptual knowledge. Via talks, posters and data blitz sessions this two day meeting will bring together experimenters and theoreticians to discuss the latest developments in the grid cell field relating to both spatial and non-spatial coding.
