## About:

The Johns Hopkins Applied Physics Lab (APL) Colloquium began in 1947. Held weekly, it is one of the longest standing technical and scientific lecture series in the Washington/Baltimore area. The goal of the Colloquium has been to bring to the Laboratory scientific scholars, technical innovators, industry leaders, government sponsors, and policy makers to inform, educate, and enlighten Laboratory staff on what is currently exciting, relevant, and of value to the work of APL.
