I’m pleased to announce that we have a new commercial licensee, Intelletic Corporation (IC), a financial startup developing an AI platform for autonomous trading of futures and other financial assets. Using Numenta’s Hierarchical Temporal Memory (HTM) technology, IC has built a proprietary Cortical Learning Model (CLM) that locates trade opportunities in financial time series and executes those trades in real time with less risk and greater return than a human discretionary trader. The team at IC has been working with HTM in open source for several years, and we’re excited to see their efforts progress to a commercial endeavor. With excellent back-test results, IC is currently raising Series A venture funding to operationalize and optimize their trading platform.

Our research team has been actively exploring our most recent brain theory development: the potential role of grid cells in the neocortex. Last month, our Co-founder Jeff Hawkins spoke on the UC Berkeley Campus at the Computational Theories of the Brain Workshop.  In his talk, “[Does the neocortex use grid cell-like mechanisms to learn the structure of objects?](/resources/papers-videos-and-more/jeff-hawkins-simons-institute-talk/)” Jeff presented our most recent research discoveries by walking through a proposal of how cortical columns pair sensory input and location to learn the structure of objects.  I invite you to watch the video of his talk and post any questions or comments on our open source discussion board [thread on the topic](https://discourse.numenta.org/t/jeff-s-talk-simons-institute/3789/13).

Research Engineer Marcus Lewis presented a poster titled “[Using Grid Cells for Coordinate Transforms](/resources/papers-videos-and-more/grid-cell-meeting/)” at the [Grid Cell Meeting](/company/events/2018/05/21/grid-cell-meeting/) in London May 21-22.  In the poster, Marcus walks through a detailed mechanism that could explain how grid cells in the cortex enable object recognition.

In partner news, [Cortical.io](http://www.cortical.io/) recently released a new version of their free tool, Iris, which allows you to perform intelligent text analysis, information extraction and text-data comparison. The latest release allows you to enter a few examples and classify your text in 8 different languages. You can learn more and download Iris [here](https://github.com/cortical-io/Iris).

Francisco Webber, Cortical.io Co-founder, will be speaking on May 29 at the [Frankfurt Finance Summit](http://www.cortical.io/company/events/frankfurt-finance-summit.html) about how financial institutions have used the Cortical.io Contract Intelligence Engine to improve information extraction for legal documents.

Lastly, we have a new piece on our blog titled “[The 2018 Machine Intelligence Landscape](https://numenta.com/blog/2018/05/16/the-2018-machine-intelligence-landscape/),” which looks at what progress has been made in the various approaches to machine intelligence – from Classic AI to Deep Learning to the Biological Neural Network. The piece is an update to a blog our co-founders Jeff Hawkins and Donna Dubinsky wrote in 2016. Check it out to see why we believe now more than ever that brain theory provides the roadmap to general machine intelligence.

Thank you for continuing to follow Numenta.
