I’m pleased to share that our co-founder, Jeff Hawkins, will be presenting new research at two upcoming events. On October 15, he will be the international keynote speaker at the [Human Brain Project Summit Open Day](/company/events/2018/10/15/human-brain-project-summit/) in Maastricht, Netherlands. He’ll deliver a talk titled, *“Location, Location, Location: A Framework for Intelligence and Cortical Computation.”* Jeff will give a preview of this talk on September 21 at the Johns Hopkins University APL Colloquium in Baltimore, Maryland. We are particularly excited about these events because they mark the first public presentations of Numenta’s framework for understanding how the neocortex works. The framework ties together major new pieces of our work, and suggests a new way of thinking about intelligence. Jeff will describe the framework, how it evolved, and what the implications may be. Both talks are open to the public, so if you’re in either area, be sure to register.

In addition to Jeff’s talks, several Numenta researchers will be presenting at upcoming events as well. On September 25, Numenta Research Scholar Mirko Klukas will present a poster titled, “Representing and integrating high-dimensional cognitive variables with grid cells” at the [Bernstein Conference](/company/events/2018/09/25/bernstein-conference/) in Berlin, Germany. Our VP of Research Subutai Ahmad will speak on October 2 at the [Centre for Theoretical Neuroscience: Colloquium Series 2018-2019](/company/events/2018/10/02/centre-for-theoretical-neuroscience/) in Waterloo, Ontario.

In partner news, Cortical.io [announced a partnership with PwC Germany](http://www.prweb.com/releases/pwc_joins_forces_with_ai_pioneer_cortical_io/prweb15712074.htm) in which PwC will develop natural language understanding solutions using [Cortical.io’s](https://www.cortical.io/) technology. The partnership aims to bring semantic search and contract analytics solutions to companies in a wide range of industries. We are thrilled to see this partnership and hope that it helps bring Cortical.io’s impressive solutions to new customers looking to make sense of their text data.

To learn more about Cortical.io and their unique approach to natural language solutions, check out our latest [Numenta On Intelligence podcast episode](/resources/numenta-on-intelligence-podcast/episode-4-natural-language-understanding-with-Francisco-Webber/), where I interviewed CEO and Co-Founder Francisco Webber. We chat about what makes them different, the many use cases where they’re seeing success, and the YouTube video of Jeff Hawkins that started it all.

Lastly, we have a new [blog post](https://numenta.com/blog/2018/09/06/evolutionary-context-of-the-neocortex/) that introduces an idea born out of our latest research. Numenta Researcher Scott Purdy sheds some light on how a location-based framework may help explain how the neocortex evolved and expanded so quickly.
Thank you for continuing to follow Numenta.
