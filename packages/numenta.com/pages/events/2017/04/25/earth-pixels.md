### Panel Discussion: Geospatial Machine Learning

This conversation veers away from specific applications to broader questions of “how to care and feed your algorithms,” what users need to know about machine learning platforms, how insights can be derived and questions posed to datasets and neural nets, and also touch on the underlying server/cloud architectures needed to support these new capabilities.
