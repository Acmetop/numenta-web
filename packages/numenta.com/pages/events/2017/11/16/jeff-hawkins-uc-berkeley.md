## Abstract:

Jeff will be giving an invited talk at the Redwood Center for Theoretical Neuroscience, which is a group of theorists consisting of faculty, postdocs and graduate students.  Led by Bruno Olshausen, it is part of the Helen Wills Neuroscience Institute at the University of California at Berkeley.  Jeff will be speaking about Numenta’s latest published research paper, [A Theory of How Columns in the Neocortex Enable Learning the Structure of the World](https://numenta.com/papers/a-theory-of-how-columns-in-the-neocortex-enable-learning-the-structure-of-the-world/), which was published in Frontiers in Neural Circuits on Oct 25, 2017.
