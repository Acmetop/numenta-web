## Anomaly Detection Benchmark

The need for anomaly detection has grown, as the Internet of Things has produced a world thatâ€™s overflowing with streaming data. As these data sources continue to grow, so does the need for anomaly detection.

Uncovering anomalies allows you to:

*	Detect potential machine failures
*	Recognize changes in Twitter activity
*	Identify unexpected traffic patterns

We created the Numenta Anomaly Benchmark (NAB) in order to be able to measure and compare results from algorithms designed to find anomalies in streaming data. NAB is an open source framework consisting of:

*	A dataset with real-world, labeled data files
*	A scoring mechanism that rewards early detection and on-line learning
