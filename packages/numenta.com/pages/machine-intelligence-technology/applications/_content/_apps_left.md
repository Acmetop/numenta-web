# HTM Applications

HTM is well suited for applications that have the following characteristics:

*	Data flowing through time: the data can be in the form of numbers, dates, text, or GPS points
*	A data sampling rate from once per minute to once per hour, with the “sweet spot” being between once per minute and once every five minutes (faster velocity data can be aggregated or sampled as well)
*	Data that has inherent structure, i.e. not entirely random
*	Many models are required rather than one large model
*	Focus of the application is prediction or anomaly detection

The following applications are examples that fit these characteristics:

*	Highlighting anomalies in the behavior of moving objects, such as tracking a fleet’s movements on a truck by truck basis
*	Understanding if human behavior is normal or abnormal on a securities trading floor
*	Predicting energy usage for a utility on a customer by customer basis
*	Predicting failure in a complex machine based on data from many sensors

In order to demonstrate these capabilities, we have created example applications.
