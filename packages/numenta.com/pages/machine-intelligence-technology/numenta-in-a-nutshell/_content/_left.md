title: Numenta in a Nutshell
description: "Numenta’s dual mission is first, to figure out how the brain works and second, to enable technology based on those principles, paving the way for the creation of Artificial General Intelligence (AGI). The team develops large scale brain theories that are testable and implemented in software."

Numenta is reverse-engineering the neocortex to solve one of science’s grand challenges: how the brain works.

### What We Do

We are a team of scientists and engineers led by Jeff Hawkins. We create and publish theories in scientific journals, test them through software simulations, and collaborate with experimental neuroscientists. Everything we do is publicly disclosed and available in open source.

### Our Progress

We’ve made a series of discoveries– from how the brain represents information to how neurons make predictions and detect anomalies to how entire cortical columns learn to model objects through movement. Our work is filling in the pieces of the common cortical circuit, which underlines all of intelligence.

### What Makes Us Unique

We are one of the few teams developing large scale theories of the brain that are biologically constrained, testable, and implemented in software. We believe our theories will be foundational to the creation of Artificial General Intelligence (AGI).

### How Our Research Will Impact the Future of Machine Intelligence

Today’s machine learning technologies are limited compared to human intelligence. Intelligent machines patterned after the brain will be able to solve many important problems that aren’t being addressed by today’s AI. Numenta is a leader in this approach.

### Our Business

We license our intellectual property for commercial applications.
