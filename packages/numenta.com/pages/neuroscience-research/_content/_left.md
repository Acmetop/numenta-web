Reverse engineering the neocortex to figure out how the brain works is one of humanityâ€™s grand scientific challenges. We are fortunate to be living in an era when neuroscience techniques are advancing at an amazing pace, giving rise to a wealth of data on everything from synapses, to neurons, to entire cortical regions.

Our neuroscience research team focuses on theory. We work with experimentalists and published results to derive an understanding of what the neocortex does and how the detailed architecture of the neocortex implements this. We test our theories via simulation, mathematical analysis, and experimental partnerships. While there are many experimental neuroscience research laboratories, Numenta is unique in its focus on large-scale cortical theory and simulation. We welcome scientific [collaborations](/contact) and often host scientists through our [Visiting Scholar Program](/company/careers-and-team/careers/visiting-scholar-program/).
