description: "The authors proposes a distributed anomaly detection system using hierarchical temporal memory (HTM) that predicts the flow of data in real time to increase security for a vehicular controller area network bus. The HTM-based anomaly detection system achieved better results than systems based on recurrent neural networks and hidden Markov model detection."
