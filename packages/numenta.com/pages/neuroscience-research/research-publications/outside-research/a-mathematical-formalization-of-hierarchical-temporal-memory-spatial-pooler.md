description: "The paper covers a key learning component in Hierarchical Temporal Memory (HTM): the spatial pooler. The spatial pooling algorithm is inspired by how the brain processes information and performs predictions on spatiotemporal data. This paper lays out a mathematical framework for it while introducing methods for using it for classification and dimensionality reduction. It also provides empirical evidence that verifies it can be used for feature learning."
