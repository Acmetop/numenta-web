description: "This Masterâ€™s thesis presents a scalable flash-based storage processor unit called Flash-HTM (FHTM), which utilizes Hierarchical Temporal Memory learning algorithms. FHTM is designed to scale with increasing model complexity. As validation, the author evaluates a mathematical model of the hardware against the MNIST dataset, yielding a 91.98% classification accuracy."
