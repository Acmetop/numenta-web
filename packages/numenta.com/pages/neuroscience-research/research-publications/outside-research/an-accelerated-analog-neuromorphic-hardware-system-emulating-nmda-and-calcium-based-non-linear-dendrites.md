description: "This paper presents an extension of the BrainScaleS accelerated analog neuromorphic hardware model by supporting multicompartment models and non-linear dendrites. Using a 65 nm prototype Application Specific Integrated Circuit (ASIC), the system emulates different spike types observed in cortical pyramidal neurons: NMDA plateau potentials, calcium and sodium spikes. Dendritic NMDA spikes are an important component of HTM theory, and the authors use our paper as a motivation for developing the hardware."
