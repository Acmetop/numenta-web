title: "CLAASIC: a Cortex-Inspired Hardware Accelerator"
author: "V. Puente, J.A. Gregorio"
category: "Hardware implementations of HTM"
org: "Preprint of journal submission"

description: "This paper explores a hardware implementation for the HTM sequence memory (in the paper they use an older term, the “Cortical Learning Algorithm” to refer to the sequence memory). The paper hypothesizes a structure that is not application dependent and performs fully unsupervised continuous learning."
