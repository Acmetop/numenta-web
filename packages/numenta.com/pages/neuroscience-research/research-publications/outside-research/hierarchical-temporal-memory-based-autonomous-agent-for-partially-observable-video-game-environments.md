description: "This Master’s thesis explores the feasibility of a Hierarchical Temporal Memory (HTM) based game agent that can explore its environment and learn rewarding behaviors. The unsupervised agent learns action sequences with respect to a stimulated reward in real time, navigating a procedurally generated 3D environment and modeling the patterns that stream to its visual sensor."
