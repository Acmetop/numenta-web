description: "This paper looks at Hierarchical Temporal Memory (HTM) and the characteristics that make it suitable for time-series based anomaly detection: continuous learning, tolerance to noise and generalization. The authors evaluate HTM on real and artificial data sets to show that HTM discovers anomalies in time-series data."
