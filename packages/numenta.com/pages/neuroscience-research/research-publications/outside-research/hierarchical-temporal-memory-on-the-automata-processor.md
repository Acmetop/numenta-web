description: "The paper introduces a methodology for synthesizing HTMs on the Automata Processor, a “configurable silicon implementation of nondeterministic finite automata, designed for massively parallel pattern matching.” The authors also demonstrate three prediction applications on their model and its potential to achieve 137-446X performance gains over CPUs."
