description: "The authors present a full-scale Hierarchical Temporal Memory (HTM) architecture for spatial pooler and temporal memory and verify it for two data sets: MNIST and the European number plate font (EUNF), with and without noise. These results suggest that the proposed architecture, using a novel form of synthetic synapses, can serve as a digital core to build HTM in hardware."
