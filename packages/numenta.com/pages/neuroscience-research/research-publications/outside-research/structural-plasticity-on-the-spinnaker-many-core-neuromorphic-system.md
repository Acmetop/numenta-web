description: "Structural plasticity is required by HTM models, but not addressed in many hardware architectures. This paper presents a model of topographic map formation that is implemented on the SpiNNaker neuromorphic platform, running in real time using point neurons, and making use of both synaptic rewiring and spike-timing dependent plasticity (STDP).  The authors use our papers as one of the motivations for working on this architecture."
