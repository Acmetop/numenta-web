description: "This paper explores the feasibility of implementing Hierarchical Temporal Memory (HTM) on SpiNNaker, a fully programmable energy-efficient neuromorphic many core system. The paper makes a proposal for mapping the HTM model components to the SpiNNaker chip architecture. It also shows a prototypic implementation of this mapping that is successfully evaluated for different sets of model parameters."
