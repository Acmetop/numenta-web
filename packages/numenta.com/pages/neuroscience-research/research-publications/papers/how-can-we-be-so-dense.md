description: "The paper walks through our implementation of brain-like SDRs in practical systems as a proof of concept. We implemented a sparse layer that can be dropped into existing deep learning and convolutional networks. We then trained sparse networks with back propagation, validated them with popular datasets and tested their accuracy with noisy images and sounds."
