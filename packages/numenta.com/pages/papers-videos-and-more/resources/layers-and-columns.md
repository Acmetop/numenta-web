This video accompanies the paper titled “Why Does the Neocortex Have Layers and Columns? A Theory of Learning the 3D Structure of the World” by Jeff Hawkins, Subutai Ahmad, and Yuwei Cui. The pre-print version of the manuscript is available on [bioRxiv](http://www.biorxiv.org/content/early/2017/07/12/162263).

It illustrates the inference mechanism described in the paper and introduces the theory of location information, showing how cortical columns can use location information to form robust predictive models of objects.

The video examines how a human recognizes objects just through touch by simulating a hand. Although the video uses touch, the same mechanism can be applied to all sensory modalities.
