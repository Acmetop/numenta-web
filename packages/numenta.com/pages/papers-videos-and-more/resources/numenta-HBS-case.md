brief: "In January 2016, Harvard Business School Professor David B. Yoffie began the process of developing a case on Numenta for his International Business Administration classes.  The question at the heart of the case: could Numenta be successful in both creating fundamental technology and building a commercial business? While we ultimately decided to be a catalyst for machine intelligence, this offers a unique look back at the history of Numenta and how we’ve tackled a dual mission over the years."

a case on Numenta for his International Business Administration classes. The question at the heart 
of the case: could Numenta be successful in both creating fundamental technology and building a
