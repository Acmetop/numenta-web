brief: "This paper proposes a network model composed of columns and layers that performs robust object learning and recognition. The model introduces a new feature to cortical columns, location information, which is represented relative to the object being sensed. Pairing sensory features with locations is a requirement for modeling objects and therefore must occur somewhere in the neocortex. We propose it occurs in every column in every region. Individual columns integrate inputs over time so that individual columns learn and recognize complete objects. Multiple columns integrate inputs over space so that recognition can occur faster."
