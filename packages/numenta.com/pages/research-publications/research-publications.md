We have a growing collection of published peer-reviewed papers, supplemental white papers and research manuscripts. You can search our publications by category or by year. Some are currently under review at journals/conferences, but we have made all manuscripts freely available on preprint sites, such as [arXiv](http://arxiv.org/) or [bioRxiv](http://biorxiv.org/).  Our goal is to document all of our discoveries in scientific journals.

You can sort through our library of [research papers](https://numenta.com/resources/papers/) by category and by year.

We also present [posters](/resources/posters) on our research at academic events throughout the year and make them available for download.
