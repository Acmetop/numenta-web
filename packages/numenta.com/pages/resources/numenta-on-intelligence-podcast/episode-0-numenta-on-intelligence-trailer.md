**Transcript - Episode 0**

Matt: Hi, I’m Matt Taylor

Christy: and I’m Christy Maver

Matt: and we are introducing a new podcast we’re producing here at Numenta called the “Numenta On Intelligence podcast.”

Christy: Now this podcast is for anybody who has a brain and is curious about how it works.

Matt: We think this is a really, really important problem – probably one of the most important problems for humanity to solve. That’s why we’re doing it.  And there’s tons of people interested in hearing how we’re doing it, so listen in to our podcast.

Christy: If you’re not familiar with Numenta, we’re building a framework for how the brain works and we created this podcast series to share with you our work and our research about it.

Matt: I don’t think anybody else is even doing this type of thing, so if you’re somebody who has an interest in your brain and is curious how it works, or a scientist or an engineer or a hobbyist or a programmer, and you want to understand how brain-based algorithms work, this is a good podcast for you to subscribe to.

Christy: We have lots of great guests lined up, from neuroscientists to Numenta researchers, and maybe some surprise guests along the way, too.

Matt: Tune in to the Numenta On Intelligence Podcast coming soon to a podcast provider near you.
