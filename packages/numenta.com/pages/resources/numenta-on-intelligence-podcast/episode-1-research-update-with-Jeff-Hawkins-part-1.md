In this in-depth interview with Numenta Co-founder Jeff Hawkins, host Matt Taylor dives deeply into concepts of location and object representation in the neocortex. In Part 1 of this 2-part interview, they discuss location, unique spaces, object compositionality & behavior, movement and learning, sequence memory, and the definition of “space” itself. In Part 2, they have an in-depth discussion on how HTM sequence memory builds object representations in space through movement.

For educational material regarding the topics discussed in this podcast episode, you have a few options. If you want to be fed the theory, watch [HTM School](https://numenta.org/htm-school/). If you need more details, there are [many papers to explore](/neuroscience-research/research-publications/papers/). If you want to talk to others about HTM theory, get involved in our [community](https://discourse.numenta.org/). For a primer on grid cells, have a look at this [interactive blog post](/blog/2018/05/25/how-grid-cells-map-space/). For more on how we think grid cells work within the neocortex, watch Jeff’s recent talk, [Does the Neocortex Use Grid Cell-Like Mechanisms to Learn the Structure of Objects?](/resources/papers-videos-and-more/jeff-hawkins-simons-institute-talk/)
