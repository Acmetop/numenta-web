## Show Notes

In this episode, we’re going to take you back to where the podcast started – a conversation with our co-founder Jeff Hawkins. Jeff shares some speculative thoughts about the role the thalamus plays in creating intelligence in the brain.

For the next few episodes, we’re going to try something a little different than the previous few episodes, which featured Interviews with Neuroscientists. Matt Taylor, our Open Source Community manager, will be bringing you conversations with Jeff Hawkins, or Subutai Ahmad, our VP of Research, on a variety of topics. These could include anything from Jeff’s latest research developments that haven’t yet been documented, to Subutai’s updates on applying our theories to today’s machine learning systems. These will be casual conversations, the kind that happen every day here at Numenta, and we want to share them with you, our listeners. Some of them may get pretty technical, but we’ll provide links to resources for further reading.
