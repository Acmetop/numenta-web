In the conclusion of our two-part interview with Numenta Co-founder Jeff Hawkins, host Matt Taylor asks Jeff about how HTM sequence memory builds object representations in space through movement.

## Show Notes

For educational material regarding the topics discussed in this podcast episode, you have a few options. If you want to be fed the theory, watch [HTM School](https://numenta.org/htm-school/). If you need more details, there are [many papers to explore](/neuroscience-research/research-publications/papers/). If you want to talk to others about HTM theory, get involved in our [community](https://discourse.numenta.org/). For a primer on grid cells, have a look at this [interactive blog post](/blog/2018/05/25/how-grid-cells-map-space/). For more on how we think grid cells work within the neocortex, watch Jeff’s recent talk, [Does the Neocortex Use Grid Cell-Like Mechanisms to Learn the Structure of Objects?](/resources/videos/jeff-hawkins-simons-institute-talk/)

*	[1:16] Different types of grid cells and orientation – what do we need to know?
*	[5:17] Border cells
*	[6:36] Object representation
* [9:07] Moving and inferring structure, beyond what we can sense
* [11:20] Difference between Cartesian coordinates and grid cells in the brain. Objects are defined by different locations and the only way to get between those locations is through movement.
* [13.38] Displacement transform using grid cells– given two points, how can I establish a vector that says how far apart they are?  
* [16.16] Mechanism for movement between locations, different locations in different reference frames
