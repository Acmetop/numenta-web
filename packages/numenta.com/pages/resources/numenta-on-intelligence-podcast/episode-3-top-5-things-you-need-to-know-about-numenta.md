New to Numenta? Bit of a beginner in brain theory? Then this episode is for you. In their 20 minute conversation, hosts Christy Maver and Matt Taylor break down the top 5 things you need to know about Numenta, including key resources for all levels of interest - from AI enthusiasts to neuroscientists - and how you can get involved.

This episode is designed for beginners. It does not require any previous knowledge about Numenta, brains, or brain theory. If you’re looking for more detailed conversations about our neuroscience research, listen to our [first two episodes](/resources/numenta-on-intelligence-podcast/episode-1-research-update-with-Jeff-Hawkins-part-1/), where host Matt Taylor interviews Numenta Co-founder Jeff Hawkins to describe the latest research developments.

## Show Notes

You’ll hear a couple repeated terms in this episode that are core to Numenta. For those who are unfamiliar with them, we’ve included definitions to help you understand. You’ll also hear Christy and Matt refer to multiple resources, which you can access through the links below.

[Hierarchical Temporal Memory (HTM)](/machine-intelligence-technology/) – HTM, which stands for Hierarchical Temporal Memory, is our biologically based technology. At the core of HTM are algorithms that learn time-based patterns in unlabeled data on a continuous basis. HTM is well suited for anomaly detection and prediction in streaming data.

[NuPIC](https://github.com/numenta/nupic) – NuPIC stands for Numenta Platform for Intelligent Computing. It’s our implementation of HTM, available in an open source project where you can find all of our core algorithms and sample application code.
