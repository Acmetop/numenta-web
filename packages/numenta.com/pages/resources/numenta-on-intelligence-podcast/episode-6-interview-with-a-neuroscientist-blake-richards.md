## Show Notes

[Blake Richards, PhD](https://twitter.com/tyrell_turing) is Assistant Professor and Associate Fellow of the Canadian Institute for Advanced Research (CIFAR).  Author of the papers, “[Toward deep learning with segregated dendrites](https://elifesciences.org/articles/22901)” and “[The Persistence and Transience of Memory](https://www.cell.com/neuron/fulltext/S0896-6273(17)30365-3),” Blake answers questions about how deep learning models can incorporate segregated dendrites, whether loss functions pertain to the neocortex and what it means to identify as a theoretical neuroscientist.
