## Show Notes

[Dr. Konrad Kording](http://kordinglab.com/) is a professor at University of Pennsylvania, known for his contributions to the fields of motor control, neural data methods, and computational neuroscience. He runs the Kording Lab, or K-Lab, which focused on computational neuroscience early on and now focuses on causality in data science applications. His lab has made an impact across many fields overtime, including [Bayesian brains](http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S1364661306001276), [causal effects in human behavior](http://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0000943), and [uncertainty in the brain](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC4946902/).

In this episode, Matt Taylor interviews Dr. Kording over Skype to discuss illusions of perception, how uncertainty might be represented in the brain, and more. A [video](https://youtu.be/RhZ7b_UBT4U) of their conversation is available on the HTM School YouTube channel.
