Sequence learning is ubiquitous in cortex. This poster explains a neural mechanism for sequence learning, HTM Sequence Memory.

Sequence Learning: Characteristics of HTM sequence memory

1. Neurons learn to recognize hundreds of patterns using active dendrites.
2. Recognition of patterns act as predictions by depolarizing the cell without generating an immediate
action potential.
3. A network of neurons with active dendrites forms a powerful sequence memory.
4. Sparse representations lead to highly robust recognition.

HTM sequence memory uses highly sparse representations, which makes it highly fault tolerant and robust to noise. Because it adapts quickly to changes due to its ability to learn continuously, it works well on real-world data.
