This poster answers the question: how can the cortex build a sensorimotor model of the world?

First, we proposed a biologically detailed model of sensorimotor inference. We know the cortex receives a copy of motor commands. We also know that most sensory changes are rapid and due to our own behavior yet our perception of the world is amazingly stable.
We built a model with a basic premise that predictable transitions lead to invariant representations. This comprises two parts: 1) We learn a predictive model of sensorimotor changes and 2) We learn stable representations of predicted changes.

We tested the model on a robotic testbed where we measured neuron activations over time as a small robot explored multiple worlds. At the beginning, neuron activations change rapidly due to movement. After learning, the same set of neurons remains active in a world despite movement.
