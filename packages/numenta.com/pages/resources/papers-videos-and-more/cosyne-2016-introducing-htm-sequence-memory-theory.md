This poster introduces a theory of sequence memory in the neocortex called HTM Sequence Memory.

The three key characteristics of HTM Sequence Memory are:

1. Neurons learn to recognize hundreds of patterns using active dendrites.
2. Recognition of patterns act as predictions by depolarizing the cell without generating an immediate
action potential.
3. A network of neurons with active dendrites forms a powerful sequence memory.

The HTM neuron models active dendrites that act as pattern detectors. Each cell can recognize hundreds of unique patterns.

HTM exhibits many desirable features for sequence learning:

- Unsupervised learning
- Quickly adapts to changes in data
- Learns high-order structure in sequences
- Robust and fault tolerant
- Makes multiple simultaneous predictions
- Works well on real-world problems
- Accurate biological model
