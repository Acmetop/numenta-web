In this poster, we show how the brain might use a grid cell code to represent sensed structures at locations in viewer-centric coordinates. This grid cell code would make it possible for the brain to calculate the location of each structure relative to some higher structure, enabling object recognition.

There are two ways of representing structures, using either viewer-centric or object-centric coordinates. Object-centric coordinates depend on the location and eye direction of the viewer, while viewer-centric coordinates depend on the location and orientation of an object.

It is most natural for the brain to build a representation of sensed features and their locations in viewer-centric coordinates. But to learn objects, a transform from viewer-centric to object-centric coordinates is needed.

We propose that just as the entorhinal cortex uses grid cells to represent an animal's location, the neocortex could use analogs of grid cells and head-direction cells to represent the animal's location relative to a sensed object.

We lay out a detailed mechanism that shows the transform routes between grid cells and the three types of operations they perform to enable object recognition.
