In the ***Brain Science Podcast***, [Dr. Ginger Campbell](http://www.virginiacampbellmd.com/ginger-campbell-md/) interviews leading scientists and shares recent discoveries from the world of neuroscience. The podcast first aired in 2006 and was in part inspired by Jeff’s book, *On Intelligence*. Jeff was [previously featured](http://brainsciencepodcast.com/bsp/interview-with-jeff-hawkins-on-intelligence-bsp-38.html?rq=jeff%20hawkins) on the ***Brain Science Podcast*** in 2008 and was invited for another interview in 2017 to talk about the progress on our work. In this episode, Jeff describes theories from two of our peer-reviewed papers published on Frontiers in Neural Circuits:
* [Why Neurons Have Thousands of Synapses, A Theory of Sequence Memory in the Neocortex](/neuroscience-research/research-publications/papers/why-neurons-have-thousands-of-synapses-theory-of-sequence-memory-in-neocortex/) (2016)
* [A Theory of How Columns in the Neocortex Enable Learning the Structure of the World](/neuroscience-research/research-publications/papers/a-theory-of-how-columns-in-the-neocortex-enable-learning-the-structure-of-the-world/) (2017)
