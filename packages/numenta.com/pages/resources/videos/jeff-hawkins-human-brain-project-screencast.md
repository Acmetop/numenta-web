On October 15, 2018 Jeff Hawkins gave a keynote presentation at the Human Brain Project Summit Open Day in Maastricht, the Netherlands. Because we were not able to get a recording of that talk, we created a screencast of Jeff presenting the material in our office. The talk covers the theory for intelligence and cortical computation that we introduced in our [recent research paper](/neuroscience-research/research-publications/papers/a-framework-for-intelligence-and-cortical-function-based-on-grid-cells-in-the-neocortex/).
