This video of Jeff Hawkins presenting at the [Johns Hopkins University APL Colloquium Series](/company/events/2018/09/21/johns-hopkins/) was the first time presenting our framework for intelligence and cortical computation, formally introduced in the paper, [A Framework for Intelligence and Cortical Function Based on Grid Cells in the Neocortex](/neuroscience-research/research-publications/papers/a-framework-for-intelligence-and-cortical-function-based-on-grid-cells-in-the-neocortex/). The talk was given as a trial run, before the paper was released, as we were figuring out how to present the materials.  We are sharing it in the hopes that it may help people understand some of the details of the framework.
