Recent advances in reverse engineering the neocortex reveal that it is a highly-distributed sensory-motor modeling system. Each cortical column learns complete models of observed objects through movement and sensation. The columns use long-range connections to vote on what objects are currently being observed. In this talk, we introduce the key elements of this theory and describe how these elements can be introduced into current machine learning techniques to improve their capabilities, robustness, and power requirements.
