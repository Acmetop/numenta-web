Spatial Pooler Algorithm
========================

The Spatial Pooler is one of the main learning algorithms in HTM. While we are working on a standalone chapter for BAMI that will detail the Spatial Pooler, for now you can explore the following resources to learn more:

- **HTM School episodes about the Spatial Pooler** • [HTM School](https://numenta.org/htm-school/) is a video tutorial series that explains concepts of HTM with an emphasis on visualizations and examples.  These episodes talk about the Spatial Pooler and related functions.

    - [Spatial Pooling: Learning (Episode 8)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rHvjykCIrZM)
    - [Boosting (Episode 9)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MSwoNAODrgk)

- **Peer-reviewed paper** • This document, authored by Yuwei Cui, Subutai Ahmad and Jeff Hawkins, is a pre-print of a paper submitted to a peer-reviewed journal. The paper contains a detailed description of the Spatial Pooler, including mathematical derivations and experimental results.

- **Overview presentation** • This recorded presentation, given by Yuwei Cui, gives an overview of the Spatial Pooler, following the outline of the peer-reviewed paper previously mentioned. Viewing this presentation in conjunction with reading the paper is recommended. A link to the slide deck used in the presentation is also given.
