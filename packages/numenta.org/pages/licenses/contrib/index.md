title: "Numenta Contributor License (CL)"
---

Although most open source projects refer to a "Contributor License Agreement
(CLA)", we have chosen to refer to this agreement as Numenta's "Contributor
License (CL)" to prevent confusion between it and the Cortical Learning
Algorithm (CLA) referenced in our source code and documentation.

Please read and sign the document below. **Use your _github username_ as the
optional "Public Name" value.** You may also download the Numenta CL in the
following formats:

* [Plain Text](numenta-cl.txt)
* [PDF](Numenta-Contributor-License.pdf)
* [Word Document](Numenta-Contributor-License.docx)
